# Third-party software and models

The engine uses the Apache-2.0 license. See the root `LICENSE`.
Dependency licenses and model licenses remain separate.
This inventory is not legal advice or a complete source-origin audit.

## Reference implementation

Crucible's EXL3 specification and CPU reference checks use ExLlamaV3 as a format reference.
The verified upstream source is commit `d3739fd393337b1ff4d6c2a342b12f0c87a9592f`.
Its [license is MIT](https://github.com/turboderp-org/exllamav3/blob/d3739fd393337b1ff4d6c2a342b12f0c87a9592f/LICENSE).
The optional tests extract selected upstream Python functions from a separate local clone.
They do not download that clone during CPU CI.

No separate vendored library tree was found in the inspected Crucible source.
This does not establish that every implementation fragment is independently authored.
Review source origins before selecting the project license or distributing binaries.
Preserve this upstream notice for any copied or substantially adapted ExLlamaV3 material:

## External build and Python dependencies

These packages are installed separately, not copied into this repository.
Package distributions can contain additional third-party notices.
Preserve their full notices when distributing an environment or a linked binary.

| ROCm HIP | GPU headers and runtime | MIT; inspect the selected ROCm distribution |
| LLVM/Clang | HIP compilation | Apache-2.0 with LLVM exceptions |
| GNU compiler runtime | Host C++ build | GPL with applicable runtime exceptions |
| Python | Tools and local HTTP frontend | Python Software Foundation License |
| NumPy | CPU numerical references | BSD-3-Clause, plus bundled notices |
| PyTorch CPU | Optional synthetic codec checks and oracle | BSD-3-Clause, plus bundled notices |
| safetensors | Python oracle weight access | Apache-2.0 |
| tokenizers | Checkpoint tokenization | Apache-2.0 |
| huggingface_hub | Optional model download | Apache-2.0 |

Direct Python package metadata was checked in the release test environment on 2026-10-03.
NumPy's wheel also declares 0BSD, MIT, Zlib, and CC0-1.0 terms.
PyTorch's CPU wheel also declares Apache-2.0, LLVM exceptions, BSD-2-Clause, BSL-1.0, and MIT terms.
Dependency resolution is not locked yet. Recheck the actual installed distributions before shipping an environment.
This source release does not include model weights or a bundled Python environment.

## Model weights

Both supported packs use **Qwen Community License 1.0**.
The license covers model artifacts separately from Crucible's engine code.
It is not Apache-2.0 or MIT.
